# NovelSort
The goal of this project was to write a program that does 2 things: 
1. Sorts two files of integers (“input_100.txt” and “input_1000.txt”) using a method called novelSort() to find the smallest and largest elements, then swapping those elements with the elements in the first and last positions in the array. The range of the values being “searched and swapped” will reduce by one on each end of the array. 
2. Takes in a transaction log .txt file containing a list of chronological transaction entries for different major cities, “NovelSortInput.txt”. Despite the misleading file name, it should sort those time stamps in the transaction log by their city names, in alphabetical order, and without compromising the preexisting chronological order of the time stamps.
